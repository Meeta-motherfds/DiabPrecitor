â€¢ This repository consists of files required to deploy a ___Web App___ created with ___Flask___ on ___Microsoft___ Azure.# diabetes_predictor
The project helps the user to identify whether someone is suffering from diabetes by simply inputting certain values like BMI, Glucose level, Blood pressure etc. with the help of a Kaggle database.

By using the statistical data about how certain aspects like BMI, Glucose level, Insulin level, age etc. impact if an individual is prone to diabetes or not, the project will be able to tell the user if the person has diabetes or not by entering those values. So in a way the project will help in monitoring the likelihood of someone developing diabetes. The project can be extended to include other diseases prediction which I will incorporate later down the road. 

I used Web Apps service of Microsoft Azure in my project and deploy the codes source from Vs Code to Azure using Github.

**Azure Services :** Azure Web App, Static Web App


Here, 
**Output** of the woking project -

**1. Main Page:**



**2. Insert values in the given fields:**



**3. Result:**



You don't have a Diabetes but if you have then output will be shows like this:

4. Again insert the values in thier fields:****



**5. And there result shows like this:**



**Deployment steps followed :**

1. Create a remote pepository on Github.

2. Clone the repository With the repository created in GitHub account, clone the project to your local machine using the git command from VS Code. git clone. 

3. Push the local Project repository to remote github repository using git commands.

4. Enabled Github Pages for the project Repo.

5.Create a static web app on Azure Cloud Portal. Create New resource group for project and Select Azure for Students Subscription. Select Deployment Details as Github. Select Repository and Branch of Repository. Review and Create.

6. for Github Actions to finish Deployment final Url : https://dbfile.azurewebsites.net/


**Conclusion :** The best clinical predictor of diabetes is adiposity, and baseline glucose is the best biological predictor.

**Thank You GitHub, Microsoft Azure, NASSCOM, FutureSkills Prime, EY, Monster for given me this wonderful opportunity**
